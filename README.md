Let me know what you think and what i can improve below. And good luck with development!

## Getting Started
- Install Nodejs from [Nodejs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open your terminal
- Navigate to the project folder
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Run `npm run serve` or `yarn serve` to start a local development server
- A new tab will be opened in your browser

You can also run additional npm tasks such as
- `npm run build` to build your app for production
- `npm run lint` to run linting.


## Vue.js
Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Vuetify
Vuetify is developed exactly according to Material Design spec. Every component is hand crafted to bring you the best possible UI tools to your next great app. The development doesn't stop at the core components outlined in Google's spec. Through the support of community members and sponsors, additional components will be designed and made available for everyone to enjoy.

## Vuex
Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official [devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.

## Axios
Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

## Sass
Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

## Vue-cli
We used the latest 3.x [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which aims to reduce project configuration
to as little as possible. Almost everything is inside `package.json` + some other related files such as
`.babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js` and `.postcssrc.js`.
